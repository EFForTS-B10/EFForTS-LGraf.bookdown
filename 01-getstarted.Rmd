# Get started {#getstarted}

## Prerequisites

In order to run EFForTS-LGraf, [NetLogo 6](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml) needs to be installed. We provide a portable version of NetLogo 6 within the [github repository](https://github.com/nldoc/EFForTS-LGraf). Because NetLogo is executed in a Java virtual machine, Java needs to be installed on the system as well. We recommend the [Oracle Java SE Development Kit 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html). 
R and the R package [nlrx, version 0.2.0](https://github.com/ropensci/nlrx) are needed in order to run some application examples of chapter \@ref(application). While the nlrx package might work without setting the Java system path explicitly, we recommend to make sure that JAVA_HOME points to the correct Java installation of the system.
The R package [landscapemetrics](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/landscapemetrics/index.html) and [landscapetools](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/landscapetools/index.html) are needed in order to run some applications examples of chapter \@ref(application).


## Basic Functions

EFForTS-LGraf is structured in three submodels. First, the landscape and households are created. Second, fields are established by the households. Third, crop types are distributed to these fields. Finally, maps can be stored as ascii files. The respective parameters and buttons are color-coded and explained in Chapter \@ref(funcpar).
